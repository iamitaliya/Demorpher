# Demorpher
Summer Semester 2020 Project




# 1 Motivation and Problem Statement
Face Morphing attacks are a threat to current travel document security. We must Design, Implement and test an Android App countering FMA with a de-morphing approach.

# 2 Tool set
For Reading face images from a document using NFC we are goinf to use jmrtd (https://jmrtd.org/)
For taking a live-image with the camera we are thinking of using a fixed ratio with guidelines to make sure every face is in the same position
For matching we have not found a workaround on how to implement dlib in an android aplication so perhaps some help from the supervisor is required.
De-morphing â€“ need some help aswell for a toolset to help us in developing the app
Visualization and evaluation: We are thinking that these should not be part of the app but rather our finidings and measurements that we did in our app. These should be included in the final report.

# 3 Concept
Design the main layout
 	
Read Photo Information from 	Passports using NFC. --> Take photo Button becomes active
 	
Take Photo with Camera ( Fixed 	Ration with Guidelines becomes active)
 	
Matching Button becomes active
 	
Matching
 	
If no matching raise an alert 	message
 	
If matching, then perform 	De-Morphing



# 4 Implementation
Same as concept but very detailed


# 5 Evaluation
Evaluation of what was implemented in the previous step.
Security Risks involved with the usage of the app.
Graphs and tables with our results go here.
